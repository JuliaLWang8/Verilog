My Verilog labs from Digital and Computer Systems course (ECE253). 
I used Quartus Prime, fake-fgpa, and ModelSim software.

Lab 2
  Part 2: implememting a 2-to-1 mux via 7400-series chips; 
  Part 3: hard-coding a hex displayer 
Lab3
  Part 1: 7-to-1 mux using switches as inputs and LEDs as outputs
  Part 2: Full adder
  Part 3: ALU using KEY combinations for functions
